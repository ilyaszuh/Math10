    "* Using the `sample` method of a pandas DataFrame, create a pandas DataFrame `df_sub` containing `n` random rows from `df_copy` and using `rs` for the random state.\n",
    "* Using `PolynomialFeatures` and `Pipeline` as in lecture on Wednesday, perform degree `d` polynomial regression on the data in `df_sub`.  (Important: be sure you are not using the full DataFrame `df_copy`.)\n",
    "* Add a new column to `df_copy` (not to `df_sub`) containing the predicted values corresponding to `df_copy[[\"x\"]]`.  (In other words, call the `predict` method of the `Pipeline` object.  We fit the regression using only `n` sample values, but we are calling predict on all the values from `df_copy`.  In Machine Learning, it is common to call `fit` and `predict` on two different datasets.)\n",
    "* Using an f-string, name this new column `\"predRS\"`, where `RS` gets replaced by the random state value.  (For example, if `rs=10`, then the column should be named `\"pred10\"`.)\n",
    "* Make a line chart in Altair from `df_copy` using the color `color`, the `\"x\"` column for the x-axis, and this `\"predRS\"` column you just made for the y-axis (you will need to use f-strings again... or maybe it would be nicer to store this string as a variable and then refer to that variable).\n",

    "* You might be able to accomplish this without using `Pipeline`, `PolynomialFeatures`, etc., but you should be able to use these on a quiz or exam."
